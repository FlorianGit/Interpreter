Interpreter

Just a test project to play around a bit with Scala. The idea to write an
interpreter I got from the blog post "Let's build a simple interpreter", from
Ruslan's Blog af https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/.
However, this project might evolve in a different direction, as it is really a
test project.
